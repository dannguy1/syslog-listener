feat: Fix import issues and improve install/uninstall scripts

## Import Fixes
- Fixed ModuleNotFoundError by converting absolute imports to relative imports
- Updated src/syslog_server.py: from .utils.parser import parse_syslog_message
- Updated src/db/models.py: from ..config import SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL
- Updated src/main.py: from .config import Config, from .syslog_server import SyslogServer
- Added missing __init__.py files in src/utils/ and src/db/ directories
- Fixed wrapper script path quoting for better compatibility

## Install Script Improvements
- Fixed database setup script reference from setup_remote_db.sh to setup_db.sh
- Added /var/log/syslog-listener to ReadWritePaths in systemd service
- Improved wrapper script creation with proper dynamic paths
- Enhanced error handling and security settings

## Uninstall Script Improvements
- Added error suppression (2>/dev/null) to prevent errors on non-existent services
- Enhanced user removal logic to handle cases where user home directory is app directory
- Added error suppression for database checks
- Improved reinstallation instructions based on what was removed

## Systemd Service Enhancements
- Added proper log directory permissions
- Enhanced security settings with ReadWritePaths
- Improved service dependencies and restart behavior

## Git Configuration
- Fixed git ownership issues by adding safe.directory configuration
- Resolved permission problems preventing file updates

## Technical Details
- All imports now use relative syntax (., ..) for proper module resolution
- Wrapper script uses quoted paths for better shell compatibility
- Systemd service includes proper log directory access
- Uninstall script handles edge cases gracefully

This commit resolves the ModuleNotFoundError issues and provides
robust installation/uninstallation scripts for production deployment.
